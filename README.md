# Introduction

I am Christian Mir G. Castillo. An ID 120 student studying in DLSU Laguna. The codes here are either incomplete or straight-up dogwater compared to your expectations. So, if you stumbled upon this repository—whether by chance or while searching for some readily-made code to "*take inspiration*" from to be able to submit for whatever course you need to submit to—tough luck because I was just as lazy (and maybe a bit dull) when I wrote these code. 

Now, if you do not care all these yapping of mine, then that's on you. I take no responsibility for any consequences you will face (imagine getting caught with plagiarism from copying below average quality code).


## True Introduction

This repository is solely for the purpose of storing my codes for the problem sets in the course Distributed Computing (STDISCM). Each problem set is divided into separate folders. The code might not be up to par with your standards, but it works so that's that. I might revisit this someday to improve things, but for now, you’ll have to bear with reading these subpar programs.
