# Introduction

I am Christian Mir G. Castillo. An ID 120 student studying in DLSU Laguna. The codes here are either incomplete or dogwater compared to your expectations. Therefore, if you have stumbled upon this repository, maybe randomly or because you were searching for readily-made codes that you can "*take inspiration*" to be able to submit for whatever course you need to submit to, then bad luck because I was also lazy (and maybe a bit dull) when I made these code. If you do not care about my yapping, then you are on your own and I do not take any responsibility for any consequences you will get (imagine getting caught with plagiarism from copying below average quality code).


## True Introduction

This repository is solely for the purpose of storing my codes for the problem sets for the course Distributed Computing (STDISCM). Each problem set is divided into separate folders, as can be seen easily. The code might not be up to par with your standards, but it works and therefore I do not care about the quality of my code. I do plan to visit this some time in the future to improve, but for now, bear with the subpar programs that I have created.
